# Framework Comparisons üîç

This document provides a comparison of the four frameworks used in this repository: Node.js, Golang, Symfony, and Spring Boot.

## Overview
In this section, we compare the frameworks based on different parameters like performance, ease of use, scalability, and community support.

## Comparison Criteria
- **Performance**: How each framework handles requests under load.
- **Ease of Setup**: How easy it is to get started with each framework.
- **Scalability**: The scalability features of each framework.
- **Community Support**: The community and ecosystem around each framework.

## Framework Comparison

| Criteria         | Node.js | Golang | Symfony | Spring Boot |
|------------------|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Performance      | High    | Very High | Moderate | High |
| Ease of Setup    | Easy    | Moderate | Moderate | Easy |
| Scalability      | High    | Very High | Moderate | High |
| Community Support| Very High | High   | High    | Very High |

## Conclusion
Each framework has its strengths and trade-offs, and the choice depends on the specific project requirements.
